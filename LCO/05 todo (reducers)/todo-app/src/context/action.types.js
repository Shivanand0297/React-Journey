// TODO: Here we define what are the things we need to do with the application

export const ADD_TODO = "ADD_TODO"
export const REMOVE_TODO = "REMOVE_TODO"

// NOW we will define the reducer file, reducer will take advantage of this TodoContext file so that he knows what to do when we hit ADD_TODO, REMOVE_TODO, etc..
